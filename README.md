Project: Fanzone App for a Football Club

**Problem Statement:**

As a football club, you want to create a fan-engagement platform that allows members to register, manage their membership status, purchase accessories, and participate in club events. You also need to manage admin access, track member attendance, and send reminders for membership renewal.

**Solution:**

This project will implement a backend API for a fanzone app that addresses the following functionalities:

1. **Member Management:**
    - Register new members and store their information (name, email, phone number, membership type, membership expiry date)
    - Update member information (e.g., change contact details)
    - Check membership status (paid or unpaid) and membership expiry date

2. **Accessories Store:**
    - List available accessories for purchase
    - Process orders for purchased accessories
    - Manage inventory of accessories

3. **Event Management:**
    - Track member attendance at club events
    - Send reminders for upcoming events
    - Identify members who haven't attended enough events for eligibility to attend important matches

4. **Admin Management:**
    - Grant access to admins to manage members, accessories, events, and club finances
    - Track number of members and membership revenue

**Technology Stack:**

1. **Backend Framework:** Flask (Python)
2. **Database:** PostgreSQL
3. **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
4. **Deployment:** Render
5. **Domain Management:** Render DNS Setup
6. **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Cloudflare

**Project Goals:**

1. **Create a fully functional backend API for the fanzone app.**
2. **Implement DevOps practices to automate the deployment, testing, and scaling of the backend application.**
3. **Secure the backend API using appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.**
4. **Build a production-ready application with a domain name and CDN integration.**

**Project Timeline:**

1. **Week 1-2:** Project planning, requirements gathering, and infrastructure setup
2. **Week 3-4:** API development for member management, accessories store, and event management
3. **Week 5-6:** Integration of admin management and CI/CD pipeline
4. **Week 7-8:** Testing, deployment, and documentation

**Expected Outcome:**

A fully functional fanzone app backend that provides a robust and secure platform for managing members, accessories, events, and admin access. The project will demonstrate the mentee's ability to apply DevOps principles, secure backend infrastructure, and build a production-ready application.
